The app script for the [**Google Form Submissions Responder**](https://script.google.com/home/projects/1sD5kaWwwTOUCbDvHz-t7Ca8JSje98lE4ZYtvZ1Y-AjrjqvLm2aVvPzAD) is set to trigger on the submission of the [**Google Form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/14-8Bw0HDyldlLrlN8q6JsKNDvpmkkYT6rRZR61OK944). The [**Google Sheet**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qKitX1kmOKV0PY8zt0TTFUdPOzSbC5GuJnxlmNBxbX8) coupled with the Google Form provides a Form Submit event trigger, which further provides a values option which gives an array of the answers provided by the form submitter. The appropriate elements from the array can be taken to use as parameters for the email.
